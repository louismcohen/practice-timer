# Practice Timer
##### This is a tool used to replace the Farmtek serial port timing system program and associated Excel spreadsheet for recording autocross lap times. It was developed for and currently used by the GM Performance Driving Team

Practice Timer was developed as a Chrome App, due to its flexibility as an internally-distributed tool that could be installed without administrator privileges on managed Windows PCs. It is functional on Chrome for macOS as well, using the testing interface to simulate connecting a serial timing device.

Times, Drivers, and Vehicles can be imported using xlsx files using respective sheet names, in the same header and data format as sample data is exported.
